###Hello there, this is Developers@Work

I am the one who made this reactJs application in the context of smartQ React Hiring Challenge
### https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hiring/smartq-reactjs-hiring-challenge/

So, let me help you run the code...

Basically the code works with just two commands
1) npm install
2) npm start

Or you can view the production file from below link
### <<COMING_SOON>>

-> Open a terminal or cmd in the directory where source code exists
-> Enter the (1) command and wait until it completes
-> Now, type the (2) command. Once it is ready it will open the application on the browser

You can also build the application using command : npm run build
